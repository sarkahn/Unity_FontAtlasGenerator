# Unity_FontAtlasGenerator
Font Atlas Generator is an editor-only Unity tool that you can use to generate tilesheets from any .ttf font with any characters the font supports.

The generator takes a string of characters and generates the tilesheet in a grid format:

You will almost always have to tweak the values a bit to get the glyphs to line up and to get it looking sharp:
